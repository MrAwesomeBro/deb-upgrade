# Ijnstall lsb-release to check the actual OS version:
apt-get install lsb-release

# Then output the version:
lsb_release -a
read -p "Press any key to continue..." -n1 -s

# Insert "jessie" to /etc/apt/sources.list
# If you want to stay stable, comment this line:
sed -i s/wheezy/jessie/g /etc/apt/sources.list

# And uncomment that one:
#sed -i s/wheezy/stable/g /etc/apt/sources.list

# Now the real deal:
apt-get update $1 && apt-get upgrade $1 && apt-get dist upgrade $1

# Last check:
echo "Done successfully. See lsb_release now:"

# Make sure the system is clean:
apt-get autoremove -y

# And last but not least the reboot:
